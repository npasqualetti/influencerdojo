We gradually continued these pranks, but it wasn't until 2008 that we were asked to have our videos put on the color television. Once this happened, our prank war truly exploded and we've on been on high alert since then. We have expanded from our individual Prank War into some amazing public pranks and social experiments\n\nIf you need to contact us with any business inquiries, prank ideas, or just to say how much you love us then send it to one of these: \npattherat112@yahoo.com   \nfuntimefederation112@gmail.com",
