    "description": "I'm Matt. I am refitting and restoring a legendary race boat, known as Duracell. Duracell was built and sailed by legendary American sailor, Mike Plant, who beat the American record for solo circumnavigation in the first Vendee Globe in 1989. I am lucky to own this piece of American racing history. With a storied past and a 25 year pause on the hard, Duracell's story now continues with us. Follow along as I refit Duracell into a fast and comfortable cruising home. My wife, Janneke and I create weekly episodes for this channel documenting every step of our project.  \n\nEmail us at theduracellproject@gmail.com\n\nFor inquiries about ad integration, please email theduracellproject@lighthouseagents.com",

    "description": "Hello. Welcome to my channel. My name is Peter and I am currently a pre-med student trying to finish up my undergrad studies. In my free time, when I do get a rare chance to have free time, I enjoy being around my cat and dog, watching the UFC, baseball and learning new things. This channel is also something I enjoy working on when I have some time. It allows me to channel some creativity in these videos and earn an extra bit of money for a struggling student. I don't have a regular posting schedule so, I post whenever I complete a video. I'm also glad that some of these videos are able to help people out. If you haven't already, please subscribe to this channel and if any of the content has helped you, please give me a thumbs up. Also, if you would like to contribute a dollar to this channel, please hit the donate button on this page.

In 2017, we sold our home and company, shipped our car and the last of our belongings to Florida, and then hopped on a plane with four suitcases, four carry-ons, and our two dogs. We bought an RV in Albuquerque and spent the next three years traveling the country, selling jewelry at art shows and festivals. When Covid-19 hit we hunkered down in Phoenix, where Kevin worked at Amazon. \n\nAfter nine months we grew restless and decided it was time to get back on the road. We chose to pivot.\n\nIn February 2021, Kevin got his CDL. In March, Kevin hit the road. In April, we set off together.\n\nJoin us on this grand adventure! \n\nthejoyoftrucking@gmail.com",

We gradually continued these pranks, but it wasn't until 2008 that we were asked to have our videos put on the color television. Once this happened, our prank war truly exploded and we've on been on high alert since then. We have expanded from our individual Prank War into some amazing public pranks and social experiments\n\nIf you need to contact us with any business inquiries, prank ideas, or just to say how much you love us then send it to one of these: \npattherat112@yahoo.com   \nfuntimefederation112@gmail.com",

Having been an examiner, I know exactly what IELTS examiners want, and my advice is correct and reliable. There’s a lot of bad information about IELTS on the Internet, so it makes sense for you to check with an ex-examiner.\n\nI create materials for self-study. I work alone, so I can’t offer face-to-face lessons or a full ‘language school’ service. My materials can be used by people who are studying alone, or by people who already attend a language school or IELTS course. Many IELTS teachers use my materials with their students too. Whatever your situation, I believe you’ll find my resources useful.\n\nContact with Simon: Ieltssimon.9@gmail.com\n\nLove you all!",

    "description": "Funk Survivor of the 23rd century, Beats, Tape, and Thumbs.\n\nThe sounds of Shuggie Otis and Michael McDonald inspired a man to write a song. A couple of Mondays later, that song inspired an Identity. The name is Otis McDonald. The mission? Good Music. \n\nFrom the mind and ears of producer/multi-instrumentalist, Joe Bagale, comes a sound that is fresh but tangibly rooted in nostalgia. When taking a listen, one may recall the soul of the 60s or the funk of the 70s. Or perhaps it’s pop radio from the 80s or the boom bap beats of the late 90s. What ever it may be, Otis McDonald is the sound of an artist who manifests a lesson in versatility and growing perspective.\n\nSoon there will be more music everywhere and in the mean time if you want to work together then by all means shoot me an email: otismacmusic@gmail.com",

    "description": "You might not expect the sound you hear from Matthew Parker, singer & producer who grew up in rural Michigan, USA. His unique blend of EDM, and Urban Pop vibes is modern and refreshing, but also sentimental and nostalgic. Taking piano lessons as a kid, Matthew wasn’t really interested in music and hated practicing, but when he found he could create his own melodies and songs, he began to discover his passion for music. Soon he was making songs by himself on the family computer at age 12. Here he discovered the magic of music production and was irreversibly hooked. Since then, with over 50 million streams across all platforms and no sign of stopping, Matthew has clearly created a sound and sentiment that resonates with many people. Life is an adventure, and music should be too. Listen to Matthew’s music to see life through the eyes of an adventurer.\n\nMerch available at http://matthewparkermusic.com!\n\nContact: matthewparkertunes@gmail.com",

    "description": "I am a 23 year old rapper who simply has a passion for venting into a microphone and in the process, hopefully helping others get through tough times.\n\n- Want to me to feature on a track of yours? I do charge $40 for one as this is my job. If you are still interested, email me at Jay140TheRapper@gmail.com\n\n- Want to use my music for your video? Sure, just give me credit in the description and tell me about it so I can check it out!\n\n- Want mixing/mastering on your song for $25? Email me (You need to have a PayPal or CashApp account)\n\nHow I got my name: When I was about 14 years old, I was a fan of an artist named J-Reyez (pronounced J Rise), but also a fan of magic tricks and a magician named Jarek 1:20. So I decided to take the two artists who inspired me the most and combine their names but with my own twist on it. I took the J from J-Reyez and changed it to Jay because I've always preferred that, and I took the 1:20 from Jarek and came up with 1:40 and my own meaning for it.",

With his powerful realization of how music can create a sense of togetherness, His mission is to make the world a better place by helping people find gratitude in everyday life, and by normalizing creative self-expression and complex human emotions. his music helps listeners to feel less alone, more empowered, and truly connected and understood.\nFor more information on booking, features, etc, please contact us.

He grew up leading praise and worship in his fathers church which taught him how to play music and how to sing. He was also a deathcore vocalist for awhile in multiple bands. Recently in the past couple of years he started adding vocals to his music and that's when he fell back in love with music and he made a lot of it. Now that he's Sadzilla, he's gone back to the basics and continues to try and speak emotion through his music.\n\nHit me up for booking and other requests at: sadzillamusic@gmail.com",

I invent and draw a series of the popular Internet meme SKIBIDI TOILET.\n\nAll content is created by myself!\n1. First I come up with a script for the video\n2. I draw each frame on my tablet by myself\n3. I mount the video in Final cut pro, connect the drawn frames\n4. Preview in Adobe Photoshop\n\n*Copyright*\nMy videos are meant to entertain others. I don't take materials from other authors, I do everything myself.\n\nDear viewers! My channel does not carry sexual meaning and has no purpose to excite the viewer. I don't post 18+ content on YouTube. In my videos there is humor with the characters, but no more! I draw all the videos myself on my tablet. This is my creative freedom. This is my freedom of imagination. Thank you for understanding!\n\nIt's my job to amuse my viewers!\n\nХудожникам и по рекламе \nТг - @pelmescka\nВк - https://vk.com/s_p2017\n\nGMAIL for all questions: krippimenov2023@gmail.com",

But there’s a lot more to me than the bubbly, taskmaster you’ve seen before on stage and screen, and I am here to give you a look at the real Cheryl Burke - raw and uncensored - behind the spray tan and rhinestones. I am a diamond painting fanatic, 30 something who is on a mission to find myself outside of the ballroom, beyond the spray tans and fringe dresses that you see on television. And I'm taking you all on the journey with my latest podcast, Burke in the Game!\n\nI hope you’ll join me on this journey of self discovery. I'll be revealing my past, present life, and looking into the future. I have exciting projects ahead and content planned for my channel, so please make sure to SUBSCRIBE and hit the bell notification!\n\nFor business inquiries: cherylburke@gushcloud.com\nTikTok: https://tiktok.com/@cherylburkeofficial\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/cherylburke",

We serve a God of no limitations.  He chooses those the world deems  as unfit to serve.  These people make major impacts for generations to come.  As we inch closer to the end of time we see biblical prophecy unfolding before our eyes, good being called evil and evil being called good.   There is a last call going forth to all the lost, a knocking on the hearts of men and women to lay their lives down for the sake of the gospel.  Let us be set apart, let us walk in holiness, let our lamps be filled when he returns for his bride.  When the storm comes, our house will stand on the firm foundation of God.  He is our rock and we are the Remnant of God. \n\nContact information: \nRemnantOfGod37@gmail.com\n\nInstagram: remnantofgodig\n\nIf you'd like to sow a seed into the ministry \nCashapp: $RemnantofGod37",

Life hasn't been easy but I'm ready to share my story. 22 of us a day end our watch and UNFORTUNATELY the VA nor the Police give 2 SCHITTS about us. I have been denied mental and primary care several times since 2020 at PERRY POINT VA MEDICL CENTER in PERRYVILLE MARYLAND, I was then given a bogus appointment and when I showed up, I was charged with 8 counts of wiretapping and a disorderly. My wife was threatened with arrest if she didn't give them my media equipment. Under duress, they illegally seized my phone from her. THIS IS DISGUSTING TO SAY THE LEAST. I'm grateful for the amount of emotional support I have received from this beautiful community. It means more to me than any amount of money would do for me, but if you are so inclined to support me that way, here are a couple links...I can't thank you enough for everything you have done for me.

We hope viewers will be able to identify the traits of a bad police officer and how to respond in a real world situation. We also celebrate and applaud the good police officers that do the right thing. The officers that go above and beyond to serve with valor, defend us, the constitution and take their oath seriously. \n\nToday’s world is drastically different than the one we once knew. The politicians in power are trying to divide us, instead of uniting us. The thought of us coming together and being united scares them.

In 2022 our wildlife video clips were used in feature films and documentaries such as Born in the Rockies: First Steps and Growing Up,  Growing Up Grizzly: A Tale of Two Orphans, and Yellowstone One-Fifty with Kevin Costner.\nWe specialize in GRIZZLY BEARS. If you are looking for the unbelievable, the unimaginable, the unattainable, the unexpected, look no further.

    "description": "Father Fish is an old time fish keeper. For 70 years he has kept fish. These are his simple, easy, guaranteed methods for keeping  healthy, happy tropical fish in your aquarium.\nLouis Foxwell adopted the role of Father Fish many years ago when he decided to open a tropical fish store as a retirement business. He had been a missionary, following in his father's footsteps for 25 years. Both men served the same congregation of deaf worshipers.\nTropical fish were Father fish's constant companion throughout his life. He tells a wonderful story about his grandmother who kept fish in Berlin, Germany as a child. \nBuy Plants, Soil Supplement, Pond Culture, Microfauna and more at https://father-fish-aquarium.myshopify.com/\nFor special items contact me at Fatherfish01@gmail.com \nTo join the Father Fish Shoal for assistance with your aquarium: https://discord.gg/G4fkAE6qNw",

That is the general knowledge about horses, how to ride them, how to tack them, how to clean them and many, many mistakes I am doing along the way. \nThis is going to be an amazing journey and I can't wait to share it all with you in coming years.\n\nYour support is much appreciated.

The biggest achievement of my career came in 2013 at La Vuelta a España when, at the age of 41, I became both the oldest and only American to ever win the Grand Tour. Now my days of racing are for the most part behind me: however, I remain in the cycling world as a commentator for NBC Sports. Now I'm hoping to bring my many years of experience in racing to YouTube, so I will have a platform to share some unique stories and helpful tips to a large audience of both up and coming amateur riders and hobby riders alike!\n\nVideos Filmed and Edited by Garrett Horner: garrettahorner@gmail.com\n\nProfile and Channel banner photo credit to Graham Watson https://www.grahamwatson.com\nChannel banner edit credit to Jaylen Tyler https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQBoeHFjeHhkc73VFpbicXw",

At the time...Behind the Line was focused on analyzing the NFL and NBA.\n\nWhen the NBA...led by LeBron James...committed to woke politics in the summer of 2020...the channel began to focus more on the political aspect in sports. Once Major League Baseball...the NFL...and the Olympics followed the NBA's lead and went woke...the channel shifted its focus from analyzing sports...to calling out anti-American athletes and leagues like the NFL, NBA, and MLB...along with prominent figures in the mainstream media.\n\nWe are committed to fighting against the politicization of sports...and upload multiple videos daily calling out anti-American athletes and the mainstream media.\n\nSupport the channel through Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/btlkc84?fan_landing=true\n\nEmail business inquiries to btlkc84@gmail.com",

My journey into night hunting started like many others living in rural communities.  I didn't start thermal/night vision hunting for fun or sport... I did it because I had to. You see, hogs and coyotes cause millions of dollars of damage and destruction each year in rural communities and our situation was no different.  Hogs continue to destroy our land and coyotes are still wrecking havoc on local cattle ranchers.  The vast majority of hunting videos that you see on this channel are hogs and predators, taken from family land... this problem is personal for me.  \n\nInstagram: @hansetx\nFacebook Page: Hans ETX\n  \nWatch our Weekly Podcast: 'The Late Night Vision Show' YouTube Channel \n\nInterested in purchasing a new Night Vision or Thermal Optic?! \nCall us: 877-350-1818\nEmail: hans@outdoorlegacygear.com\nwww.outdoorlegacygear.com",

Ben built out the van from scratch, and documented the entire process here. Each build step comes complete with lessons learned and both failed and successful techniques, all for your benefit. \n\nThen joined a woman Julie, and another dog, Reli, and sadly, Archer left this world. It was a tough and changing time, but the new crew managed to pull off a second van build, the Mercedes Sprinter. Again, the whole process was filmed and meticulously spelled out for the eager DIY van builder in each of us. Enjoy the library of build tutorials and reach out to us at dogcatmanvan@gmail.com with any questions!\n\nWith two builds done, the man, Ben, and the woman, Julie, decided to set out on the road in search of great adventure and purpose.

After a decade of exploring the world with my best friend for our TV show 'Rock the Park,' I decided that it was time for a new adventure - starting a family and returning to my home state of Minnesota. Since then, I've built two tiny cabins and make frequent trips to our family cabin in the scenic Northwoods of Minnesota. Tune into my channel for adventures in our cabins and navigating this new adventure of parenthood.\n\n\nPartner with Us on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/tinycabinlife\n\nwww.jacksteward.com\n\nFor Business Inquiries: \nSmall Screen Marketing\neric.lecuyer@smallscreenmarketing.com\n\nSOCIAL:\nInstagram: @jackfsteward\nTwitter: @jackfsteward\nFacebook Page: /JackFStewardRTP (Search for Jack Steward)",

During our time doing this we have captured many unexplainable events within the paranormal field which has gave us a motive to continue searching. I wouldn't call ourselves die hard investigators, Chelsey and I are just obsessed with the paranormal, and she is a practicing medium. currently we aim to document as many places around the world as we can through paranormal investigating, living and learning along the way. Do not attempt to venture to these sites, these sites can be very dangerous if not careful enough. All things considered, in a world of constant chaos, we all need to escape reality sometimes so Im just a dude with camera gear who wants to bring you guys along for the ride to educate & entertain our community through our videos while having some fun.

Why was this farmhouse or barn or outbuilding or schoolhouse abandoned, left to decay in the elements? I feel a certain sense of sadness knowing that once this building stood strong and proud.\n\nBut, yet, I manage to see the beauty in the bones that remain—in weathered boards muted to soft shades of gray, in crooked doors clinging to rusty hinges, in roofs that sag under the weight of time.\nIn my mind, I have personified this abandoned building, given it new life, through my photos and my poetic thoughts.'",

Experiencing North America as Full-time RV Travelers in a custom trailer called Orion, a Smart car named Pathfinder and a Volvo semi-truck we refer to as Voyager.\nAs RV Fulltime living since January 2016, we have experience that has been gained along the way that we want to share with the RV community and give back to those curious about this type of lifestyle. We'll share tips and information about traveling in general and in particular with a very large rig.\nWe also want to demonstrate to everyone that it's possible to explore this great country of ours in a custom 47' fifth wheel and not compromise on the path you choose.\nWe believe the Journey is the Destination, so come along with us to discover What's Next.\n\nOur email: bigtrucksbigtravel@gmail.com",

Additionally, I truly believe in 'Giving Back' to the community anyway I can. Most recently I donated an entire month of my revenue from my YouTube & Patreon to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. \n\nI will be documenting my FKT (Fastest Known Time) attempt of the Superior Hiking Trail later in 2017 and my thru-hike of the John Muir Trail in the Fall.\n\nFor Business Inquires:\nFollowbigfoot@yahoo.com\n\nFollow Bigfoot is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program and other affiliate advertising programs designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to amazon.com and other websites.\n\n#AvantLink",

After spending a full year focused on such a defined goal, in 2022 we continued our travels in the US and abroad. On one of our trips, we came across the #1 New York Times bestseller book “1,000 Places to See Before You Die” and were immediately drawn in and knew that it had to be a part of our adventures. With the book serving as inspiration, in January 2023 we launched a new series where we’ve now set out to see as many of the “1,000 Places To See Before You Die”… before we die!\n\nWe hope you’ll join us on the adventure & find some adventures of your own along the way! And remember... It’s better to see something once (even if only for a moment) than to hear about it a thousand times.\n\nFor Business Inquiries: AdventuresofMattandNatBusiness@gmail.com",

I wanted to share yoga and wellness practices with people around the world in a way that's fun and accessible. \n\nOriginally the 'floating' aspect of Floating Yoga School came from living on a sailboat. These days it represents so much more: going with the flow of life, the very real but virtual aspect of online connection, and the dream of traveling again (soon!). \n\nI currently offer YouTube membership exclusive content, online 200-hour yoga teacher trainings, and private classes for groups and individuals. The best way to connect is via email - Helen@FloatingYogaSchool.com. - http://www.floatingyogaschool.com\n\nThank you for your support!",
