    "description": "I'm Matt. I am refitting and restoring a legendary race boat, known as Duracell. Duracell was built and sailed by legendary American sailor, Mike Plant, who beat the American record for solo circumnavigation in the first Vendee Globe in 1989. I am lucky to own this piece of American racing history. With a storied past and a 25 year pause on the hard, Duracell's story now continues with us. Follow along as I refit Duracell into a fast and comfortable cruising home. My wife, Janneke and I create weekly episodes for this channel documenting every step of our project.

    "description": "Hello. Welcome to my channel. My name is Peter and I am currently a pre-med student trying to finish up my undergrad studies. In my free time, when I do get a rare chance to have free time, I enjoy being around my cat and dog, watching the UFC, baseball and learning new things. This channel is also something I enjoy working on when I have some time. It allows me to channel some creativity in these videos and earn an extra bit of money for a struggling student. I don't have a regular posting schedule so, I post whenever I complete a video. I'm also glad that some of these videos are able to help people out. If you haven't already, please subscribe to this channel and if any of the content has helped you, please give me a thumbs up.

    "description": "Are you curious about trucking?  Looking for information, tips, and insights?  Are you an armchair traveler who wants to join us for some fun and adventure on the roads of America?  Ride along with us as we discover and share all that trucking and this continent have to offer!  We lived on the Caribbean island of St. Croix for twenty years. In 2017, we sold our home and company, shipped our car and the last of our belongings to Florida, and then hopped on a plane with four suitcases, four carry-ons, and our two dogs. We bought an RV in Albuquerque and spent the next three years traveling the country, selling jewelry at art shows and festivals. When Covid-19 hit we hunkered down in Phoenix, where Kevin worked at Amazon.   After nine months we grew restless and decided it was time to get back on the road. We chose to pivot.  In February 2021, Kevin got his CDL. In March, Kevin hit the road. In April, we set off together.  Join us on this grand adventure!   thejoyoftrucking@gmail.com",

My videos are a combination of throwbacks to the good 'ol days of trucking, truck detailing tips that I've used over the years, and walk around through some really great truck shows!

We started filming in 2003 when we were just young lads, but that evolved in the year 2007 when we made our first few prank videos and gained some recognition for them on some internet sites. We gradually continued these pranks, but it wasn't until 2008 that we were asked to have our videos put on the color television. Once this happened, our prank war truly exploded and we've on been on high alert since then. We have expanded from our individual Prank War into some amazing public pranks and social experiments  If you need to contact us with any business inquiries, prank ideas, or just to say how much you love us then send it to one of these:  pattherat112@yahoo.com    funtimefederation112@gmail.com",

    "description": "My name is Simon Corcoran, and this is my mission as an IELTS teacher:  I aim to provide the best information about the IELTS test, from an ex-examiner’s perspective. Having been an examiner, I know exactly what IELTS examiners want, and my advice is correct and reliable. There’s a lot of bad information about IELTS on the Internet, so it makes sense for you to check with an ex-examiner.  I create materials for self-study. I work alone, so I can’t offer face-to-face lessons or a full ‘language school’ service. My materials can be used by people who are studying alone, or by people who already attend a language school or IELTS course. Many IELTS teachers use my materials with their students too. Whatever your situation, I believe you’ll find my resources useful.  Contact with Simon: Ieltssimon.9@gmail.com  Love you all!",

Welcome to my Channel!  If you're here, that means you've probably already experienced ASMR, or curiosity has brought you here to test the waters. Whatever your reason, I'm glad it led you to me.  I've loved ASMR before I knew what it was. Over the years, I've relied on soft spoken massage videos to put me to sleep or to ease my anxiety. Never once acknowledging it as an art or practice. Now that I know my strange aid really isn't that strange, I'm ready to give back.   I'm here because there aren't that many ASMRtists who look like me. I hope to change that.",

    "description": "Funk Survivor of the 23rd century, Beats, Tape, and Thumbs.  The sounds of Shuggie Otis and Michael McDonald inspired a man to write a song. A couple of Mondays later, that song inspired an Identity. The name is Otis McDonald. The mission? Good Music.   From the mind and ears of producer/multi-instrumentalist, Joe Bagale, comes a sound that is fresh but tangibly rooted in nostalgia. When taking a listen, one may recall the soul of the 60s or the funk of the 70s. Or perhaps it’s pop radio from the 80s or the boom bap beats of the late 90s. What ever it may be, Otis McDonald is the sound of an artist who manifests a lesson in versatility and growing perspective.  Soon there will be more music everywhere and in the mean time if you want to work together then by all means shoot me an email: otismacmusic@gmail.com",

    "description": "You might not expect the sound you hear from Matthew Parker, singer & producer who grew up in rural Michigan, USA. His unique blend of EDM, and Urban Pop vibes is modern and refreshing, but also sentimental and nostalgic. Taking piano lessons as a kid, Matthew wasn’t really interested in music and hated practicing, but when he found he could create his own melodies and songs, he began to discover his passion for music. Soon he was making songs by himself on the family computer at age 12. Here he discovered the magic of music production and was irreversibly hooked. Since then, with over 50 million streams across all platforms and no sign of stopping, Matthew has clearly created a sound and sentiment that resonates with many people. Life is an adventure, and music should be too. Listen to Matthew’s music to see life through the eyes of an adventurer.  Merch available at http://matthewparkermusic.com!

Most experts agree that the success of Disco Lines’ music career is matched only by his standing as an industry-leading amateur Dolphin enthusiast. When he is long gone, Disco Lines hopes to be remembered for his upbeat dance music, and as a fierce protector of our cetacean friends.  contact: gon@fimigroup.com; eli@fimigroup.com",

    "description": "I am a 23 year old rapper who simply has a passion for venting into a microphone and in the process, hopefully helping others get through tough times.  - Want to me to feature on a track of yours? I do charge $40 for one as this is my job. If you are still interested, email me at Jay140TheRapper@gmail.com  - Want to use my music for your video? Sure, just give me credit in the description and tell me about it so I can check it out!  - Want mixing/mastering on your song for $25? Email me (You need to have a PayPal or CashApp account)  How I got my name: When I was about 14 years old, I was a fan of an artist named J-Reyez (pronounced J Rise), but also a fan of magic tricks and a magician named Jarek 1:20. So I decided to take the two artists who inspired me the most and combine their names but with my own twist on it. I took the J from J-Reyez and changed it to Jay because I've always preferred that, and I took the 1:20 from Jarek and came up with 1:40 and my own meaning for it.",

Or the sound of a favorite song played over and over again? In a world filled with loneliness, I believe that glimpses of 'home” are hidden all around us; At the heart of the things that we love and in the moments that make us feel alive. Home is somehow connected to the essence of who we really are. And what if chasing the meaning of home is the key to finding a meaningful life?  I’m Juniper Vale and I write songs that explore the meaning of home.

He grew up leading praise and worship in his fathers church which taught him how to play music and how to sing. He was also a deathcore vocalist for awhile in multiple bands. Recently in the past couple of years he started adding vocals to his music and that's when he fell back in love with music and he made a lot of it. Now that he's Sadzilla, he's gone back to the basics and continues to try and speak emotion through his music.  Hit me up for booking and other requests at: sadzillamusic@gmail.com",

All content is created by myself! 1. First I come up with a script for the video 2. I draw each frame on my tablet by myself 3. I mount the video in Final cut pro, connect the drawn frames 4. Preview in Adobe Photoshop  *Copyright* My videos are meant to entertain others. I don't take materials from other authors, I do everything myself.  Dear viewers! My channel does not carry sexual meaning and has no purpose to excite the viewer. I don't post 18+ content on YouTube. In my videos there is humor with the characters, but no more! I draw all the videos myself on my tablet. This is my creative freedom. This is my freedom of imagination. Thank you for understanding!  It's my job to amuse my viewers!

But there’s a lot more to me than the bubbly, taskmaster you’ve seen before on stage and screen, and I am here to give you a look at the real Cheryl Burke - raw and uncensored - behind the spray tan and rhinestones. I am a diamond painting fanatic, 30 something who is on a mission to find myself outside of the ballroom, beyond the spray tans and fringe dresses that you see on television. And I'm taking you all on the journey with my latest podcast, Burke in the Game!  I hope you’ll join me on this journey of self discovery. I'll be revealing my past, present life, and looking into the future.

    "description": "Don’t lose hope.  You have a purpose, a calling, a reason you are alive.  God is establishing his kingdom here on earth and you are called to labor along side him.  We serve a God of no limitations.  He chooses those the world deems  as unfit to serve.  These people make major impacts for generations to come.  As we inch closer to the end of time we see biblical prophecy unfolding before our eyes, good being called evil and evil being called good.   There is a last call going forth to all the lost, a knocking on the hearts of men and women to lay their lives down for the sake of the gospel.  Let us be set apart, let us walk in holiness, let our lamps be filled when he returns for his bride.  When the storm comes, our house will stand on the firm foundation of God.  He is our rock and we are the Remnant of God.   Contact information:  RemnantOfGod37@gmail.com  Instagram: remnantofgodig  If you'd like to sow a seed into the ministry  Cashapp: $RemnantofGod37",

Life hasn't been easy but I'm ready to share my story. 22 of us a day end our watch and UNFORTUNATELY the VA nor the Police give 2 SCHITTS about us. I have been denied mental and primary care several times since 2020 at PERRY POINT VA MEDICL CENTER in PERRYVILLE MARYLAND, I was then given a bogus appointment and when I showed up, I was charged with 8 counts of wiretapping and a disorderly. My wife was threatened with arrest if she didn't give them my media equipment. Under duress, they illegally seized my phone from her. THIS IS DISGUSTING TO SAY THE LEAST. I'm grateful for the amount of emotional support I have received from this beautiful community. It means more to me than any amount of money would do for me, but if you are so inclined to support me that way, here are a couple links...I can't thank you enough for everything you have done for me. I love you all, well not all of you but most. TAV family ADIOS!!!! Newlifebearing@yahoo.com",

We hope viewers will be able to identify the traits of a bad police officer and how to respond in a real world situation. We also celebrate and applaud the good police officers that do the right thing. The officers that go above and beyond to serve with valor, defend us, the constitution and take their oath seriously.   Today’s world is drastically different than the one we once knew. The politicians in power are trying to divide us, instead of uniting us. The thought of us coming together and being united scares them. We The People are in charge and not them.  DISCLAIMER: None of our videos should be considered a 'call to action”. We are not attorneys. Our videos should not be construed as legal advice. You should seek legal counsel if you believe that you are a victim of police misconduct.

We live in the Tetons and work 260 days a year. Traveling over 35,000 miles/year we capture only the biggest and best of Rocky Mountain wildlife. You see what we see, nothing is added or removed. We have over 4500 4K video clips that are used in advertising, films, documentaries, television and education in over 50 countries world wide. In 2022 our wildlife video clips were used in feature films and documentaries such as Born in the Rockies: First Steps and Growing Up,  Growing Up Grizzly: A Tale of Two Orphans, and Yellowstone One-Fifty with Kevin Costner. We specialize in GRIZZLY BEARS. If you are looking for the unbelievable, the unimaginable, the unattainable, the unexpected, look no further.

Louis Foxwell adopted the role of Father Fish many years ago when he decided to open a tropical fish store as a retirement business. He had been a missionary, following in his father's footsteps for 25 years. Both men served the same congregation of deaf worshipers. Tropical fish were Father fish's constant companion throughout his life. He tells a wonderful story about his grandmother who kept fish in Berlin, Germany as a child.

I have 30 guppy tubs and 30 aquariums in my backyard.  These tubs are elevated off the ground so I can easily maintain them.  Each tub and aquarium has aeration with a sponge filter.    The great thing about this set up, is that it takes up a very small area of my backyard.  I have 15 different guppy strains.  Red Dumbo Mosaic. Gold Metal Lace. Black Metal Lace. Dumbo Red Fire Mosaic. Platinum Galaxy Tiger. Blue Star Galaxy. Blue Head Moscow. Dumbo Red Tail (Patriot). Tuxedo Koi. Green Moscow. Blue Diamond. HB Purple. Full Red. HB Yellow Leopard.

    "description": "Hi In this channel you will find my entire journey with horses. I started horse riding lessons back when I was 4 at Snowball Farm.  Now I'm 8 and my parents decided to invest and they got me Louis, a 13.2 pony who is the most adorable pony ever! I keep my pony Louis in stable at Snowball Farm and I am trying to be here every day.  I created this channel so I can share with you my entire journey with my pony Louis and the entire process of gaining the necessary experience with horses. That is the general knowledge about horses, how to ride them, how to tack them, how to clean them and many, many mistakes I am doing along the way.  This is going to be an amazing journey and I can't wait to share it all with you in coming years.  Your support is much appreciated. Every like and comment and of course subscription is a great help in growing my channel.  Thank you all and I hope you like my videos ;)  natalia@mtpcooling.Co.uk",

    "description": "Hello, I'm Chris Horner; I was a pro cyclist for over 20 years. Throughout my career I've participated in countless races and won many of them. The biggest achievement of my career came in 2013 at La Vuelta a España when, at the age of 41, I became both the oldest and only American to ever win the Grand Tour. Now my days of racing are for the most part behind me: however, I remain in the cycling world as a commentator for NBC Sports. Now I'm hoping to bring my many years of experience in racing to YouTube, so I will have a platform to share some unique stories and helpful tips to a large audience of both up and coming amateur riders and hobby riders alike!

Most of the content found on this channel (highlights, bloopers, historic moments etc.) is several years old. The intent is to 'resurrect'  these clips and snippets to the new generation of disc golfers and newer viewers, and present them with the original FULL round coverage or video links. This ensures promotion of the disc golfers, the disc golf media/production channels, and other sources. All original sources of the disc golf news or highlights that I cover always have been and always will be listed in my video descriptions for direct links to their channels.---Here is where you will find a little of everything interesting... enjoy and please consider subscribing to the channel as well as the linked channels and sources!

    "description": "Behind the Line is a YouTube channel dedicated to calling out woke politics. The channel was started by KC in August of 2019. At the time...Behind the Line was focused on analyzing the NFL and NBA.  When the NBA...led by LeBron James...committed to woke politics in the summer of 2020...the channel began to focus more on the political aspect in sports. Once Major League Baseball...the NFL...and the Olympics followed the NBA's lead and went woke...the channel shifted its focus from analyzing sports...to calling out anti-American athletes and leagues like the NFL, NBA, and MLB...along with prominent figures in the mainstream media.  We are committed to fighting against the politicization of sports...and upload multiple videos daily calling out anti-American athletes and the mainstream media.

My journey into night hunting started like many others living in rural communities.  I didn't start thermal/night vision hunting for fun or sport... I did it because I had to. You see, hogs and coyotes cause millions of dollars of damage and destruction each year in rural communities and our situation was no different.  Hogs continue to destroy our land and coyotes are still wrecking havoc on local cattle ranchers.  The vast majority of hunting videos that you see on this channel are hogs and predators, taken from family land... this problem is personal for me.

Ben built out the van from scratch, and documented the entire process here. Each build step comes complete with lessons learned and both failed and successful techniques, all for your benefit.   Then joined a woman Julie, and another dog, Reli, and sadly, Archer left this world. It was a tough and changing time, but the new crew managed to pull off a second van build, the Mercedes Sprinter. Again, the whole process was filmed and meticulously spelled out for the eager DIY van builder in each of us. Enjoy the library of build tutorials and reach out to us at dogcatmanvan@gmail.com with any questions!  With two builds done, the man, Ben, and the woman, Julie, decided to set out on the road in search of great adventure and purpose.

During our time doing this we have captured many unexplainable events within the paranormal field which has gave us a motive to continue searching. I wouldn't call ourselves die hard investigators, Chelsey and I are just obsessed with the paranormal, and she is a practicing medium. currently we aim to document as many places around the world as we can through paranormal investigating, living and learning along the way. Do not attempt to venture to these sites, these sites can be very dangerous if not careful enough. All things considered, in a world of constant chaos, we all need to escape reality sometimes so Im just a dude with camera gear who wants to bring you guys along for the ride to educate & entertain our community through our videos while having some fun.

I'm excited to share the journey with you and hear all about your world too.   My blog WWW.PAUPERTOPRINCESS.COM is all about finding stunning, on trend, charity shop bargains so if you're a fellow fashionista head over there too.   Keep an eye out for new videos every Tuesday at 6pm (GMT) and of course don't forget to subscribe.  Follow me here, or contact me on paupertoprincess@gmail.com",

    "description": "Finding abandoned farms is my thing!  Contact me: farmhuntermn@gmail.com  'Abandoned farmhouses and rural buildings have always held a special fascination for me. As odd as this seems, I see poetry in these buildings that lean against the landscape, that view the world through shattered lenses.  I often wonder: Who lived or worked here? Why was this farmhouse or barn or outbuilding or schoolhouse abandoned, left to decay in the elements? I feel a certain sense of sadness knowing that once this building stood strong and proud.  But, yet, I manage to see the beauty in the bones that remain—in weathered boards muted to soft shades of gray, in crooked doors clinging to rusty hinges, in roofs that sag under the weight of time. In my mind, I have personified this abandoned building, given it new life, through my photos and my poetic thoughts.'",

Since getting off the Trial, I have dedicated the majority of this channel to helping upcoming Thru-Hikers on how to plan, prepare and trail tips to give them a better change to complete their upcoming Appalachian Trail section or Thru-Hike. Additionally, I truly believe in 'Giving Back' to the community anyway I can. Most recently I donated an entire month of my revenue from my YouTube & Patreon to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy.   I will be documenting my FKT (Fastest Known Time) attempt of the Superior Hiking Trail later in 2017 and my thru-hike of the John Muir Trail in the Fall.

We launched in 2021 by visiting all 50 US states & documented our entire journey on our Blog & here on YouTube! After spending a full year focused on such a defined goal, in 2022 we continued our travels in the US and abroad. On one of our trips, we came across the #1 New York Times bestseller book '1,000 Places to See Before You Die” and were immediately drawn in and knew that it had to be a part of our adventures. With the book serving as inspiration, in January 2023 we launched a new series where we’ve now set out to see as many of the '1,000 Places To See Before You Die”… before we die!  We hope you’ll join us on the adventure & find some adventures of your own along the way! And remember... It’s better to see something once (even if only for a moment) than to hear about it a thousand times.  For Business Inquiries: AdventuresofMattandNatBusiness@gmail.com",

We write travel guides & help people open their eyes to alternative living, whether that be teaching English online, moving overseas, taking advantage of working holiday visas or building a DIY stealthy camper van to live & work on the road. We lived the #vanlife in our self-converted van for 3 years and now are embarking on a journey of living abroad & backpacking around the wrold.  Our goal here is to bring you weekly content where we hope to inspire you to break free & live the life you desire. We talk everything from finances to minimalism to working online to mindset and on Saturdays, we post a weekly vlog of our daily lives. We hope you join us on our journey to see the world, save money, live minimally, and chase your dreams, no matter what your bank account looks like.  Biz: notluxe@influint.co",

We’re Jimmy & Natalie and we live full-time on the road. 🚐🏔  Our journey started in early 2021, when we bought an old school bus and converted it into a #skoolie so that we could explore the States. After one year of making memories in our bus, Saguaro, we made the tough decision to sell her and downsize to our second conversion.     Two long months later, we completed our van conversion, Pancake! We now get to experience #vanlife as we travel throughout North America. There’s so much to see and experience, and we’d love for you to come along for the ride!

    "description": "Hi friends! Welcome to the Floating Yoga School YouTube channel. I started Floating Yoga School after many years working in the yoga and wellness industries. I wanted to share yoga and wellness practices with people around the world in a way that's fun and accessible.   Originally the 'floating' aspect of Floating Yoga School came from living on a sailboat. These days it represents so much more: going with the flow of life, the very real but virtual aspect of online connection, and the dream of traveling again (soon!).   I currently offer YouTube membership exclusive content, online 200-hour yoga teacher trainings, and private classes for groups and individuals. The best way to connect is via email - Helen@FloatingYogaSchool.com. - http://www.floatingyogaschool.com  Thank you for your support!",
