                We endeavor to respond to a verifiable Consumer request within the
                timeframes set forth in the CCPA. If applicable, in our response, we
                will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request.

                We will not discriminate against you in a manner prohibited by the
                CCPA because you exercise your CCPA rights. Please note that to use
                our Services, we do require the collection of your personal
                information – for example, to sign you up or to complete a paid
                transaction. While you may request to delete your personal information
                under CCPA, such deletions may affect our ability to offer the
                Services.
